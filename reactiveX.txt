publishers
	- Flowable: A Publisher that emits 0..N elements, and then completes successfully or with an error.
	- Observable: Similar to Flowables but without a backpressure strategy. They were introduced in RxJava 1.x.
	- Single: It completes with a value successfully or an error.(doesnâ€™t have onComplete callback, instead onSuccess(val)).
	- Maybe: It completes with/without a value or completes with an error.
	- Completable: It just signals if it has completed successfully or with an error.
